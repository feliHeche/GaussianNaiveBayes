## 1. Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. 
The goal is to provide a simple and clear implementation that might help some people to better understand 
this straightforward yet effective model.


## 2. Structure
This repository is organised as follows.

- `Theoretical_background.pdf:` a pdf that present an overview of the mathematical foundations of the
Naive Bayes classifiers.
- `GaussianNaiveBayes.py:` a python file that implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
- `GaussianNaiveBayes_test.ipynb:` a jupyter notebook that
  
  - tests our Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation.
  - compares its performance against the implementation provided by `scikit-learn`.
